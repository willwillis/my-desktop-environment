# Dracula Theme

Dracula is close enough to an ideal theme. What I like about it is the coverage and depth.

## Telegram

`git clone https://github.com/dracula/telegram.git`

### Activating theme
  - In Telegram Desktop, go to Setting, on Chat Settings, click on kebab menu (three dots) and Create new theme then import existing theme.
  - Select the colors.tdesktop-theme file you just downloaded.
  - Click Keep Changes to apply the theme.
  - Click Save theme.
  - On Theme name set Dracula, click on Choose from file and select tiled.png file you just downloaded.
  - Click save to apply the background.
